# G431 ESC MATLAB tools
MATLAB models, simulation models, data processing scripts



## Dependencies
The scripts in this repo requires the following MATLAB toolboxes:

1. Simulink
2. Control System Toolbox
3. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
4. Symbolic Math Toolbox



Furthermore the scripts depends on some of the functions from our [MATLAB-tools repo](https://github.com/mindThomas/MATLAB-tools) which is already pulled in as a submodule (assuming that you followed the cloning instructions mentioned in the [upper-level README](../README.md))
