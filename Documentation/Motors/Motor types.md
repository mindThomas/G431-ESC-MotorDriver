## Spur Pinion gear
Spur gears are the most common type of gear, and are also the most simple. They have straight teeth that are produced parallel to the axis of the gear. Since they have the simplest design, they are the easiest to design and manufacture, and are therefore the most economical type of gear. Spur gears are not known to be the smoothest or quietest gears, but they are highly efficient and produce a lot of power. They run well at slow to moderate speeds, but they tend to vibrate and become noisy at higher speeds.

## Helical Pinion gear
Helical Gears have teeth that are set on an angle to the gear axis. Since the teeth engage more gradually, they have a smoother and quieter operation than spur gears. Helical gears also have greater tooth strength and a higher load carrying capacity. Furthermore, helical gears can transmit power between either parallel or non-parallel shafts, while spur gears can only transfer power between parallel shafts. A downside to helical gears is they produce an axial force that needs to be accounted for; something not needed with spur gears.

    - The original 37D gearmotors with spur pinion gears have been replaced by newer versions that feature helical gears for the first stage of the gearbox, which makes the gearbox a little quieter and more efficient. The performance is otherwise unchanged, and the dimensions are the same, so the new versions with helical pinion gears can be used as direct replacements for the original units.
